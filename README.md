# gradient-generator

- Project from Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course
- This project is made with vanilla JavaScript. On Mac, the color picker can dynamically change the background as you change the color in the picker, but on windows, it doesn't work like that

## Things to add

- jscolor.js (maybe)
- Buttons to change the type / direction of the gradient
  - Previews of each of these (the button could have the background of it)
