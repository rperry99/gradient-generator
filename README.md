# gradient-generator

- Project from Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course
- This project is made with vanilla JavaScript. On Mac, the color picker can dynamically change the background as you change the color in the picker, but on windows, it doesn't work like that

## Things to check out

- Use jscolor.js to set the colors so it is dynamic on all platforms
